# DungeonCrawler
This is my first project.
It is a text-based dungeon crawler that also utilizes the StdDraw-library to display the dungeon rooms.
To play the game, simply download the repository (.zip) and double click the '.sh' file in the "DungeonCrawler"-folder (select the "Run in Terminal" option).
### Note: The '.sh' file only works on linux!
To play it on Windows, you need to have the 'DungeonCrawler' folder on the desktop and run the following in the terminal:

cd C:\Users\%USERPROFILE%\Desktop\DungeonCrawler && DungeonCrawler1.1.jar
