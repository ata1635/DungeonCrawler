# DungeonCrawler
This is my own first project.
It is a text based dungeon crawler which also utilizes the StdDraw-library to display the dungeon rooms.
To play the game just download the 'DungeonCrawler' folder and run the '.sh' file.
### !!! The '.sh' file only works on linux !!!
to play it on Windows, you need to have the 'DungeonCrawler' folder on the desktop and run the following in the terminal:

cd C:\Users\USERPROFILE\Desktop\FolderName && "game-name.exe"

The USERPROFILE is your windows-username
